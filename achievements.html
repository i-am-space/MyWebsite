                    <ul>
                        <li>idk how this one happened</li>
                        <li>Problem statement: generate returns on Bitcoin between 2018 and 2022 with an algorithmic trading strategy.</li>
                        <li>Generated the highest return percentage of all the teams present.</li>
                        <li>Three rounds, 5,800 teams, 23,000 people and one trip to IIT-KGP later, we emerged in third place as the only first-year two-man team to make it to the finals and get placed.</li>
                        <li>Actual strategy revolved around using the XGBoost AI model as a classifier to segregate signals generated by an underlying moving average crossover strategy (24 and 59 days) as worthwhile or not depending on the sole imputed feature that was RSI (14-day period)</li>
                        <li>This brainwave followed two disastrous models that can be found on the wall of shame in the project GitHub</li>
                        <li>if only the prize money covered the cost of the trip.</li>
