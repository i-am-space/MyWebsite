                <h2>EARLY SCHOOLING</h2>
                <p>
                    I went to National Public School (NPS), Rajajinagar in Bangalore. <br><br>
                    I stayed in this school throughout my schooling career. <br><br>
                    I was part of the school basketball team (and later volleyball team).<br><br>
                    In 11th grade, I was the School Vice-Prefect, and in 12th grade I was the School Prefect.<br>

                <h2>HIGHER SCHOOLING</h2>
                <p>
                    For my 11th and 12th grade, I (surprise, surprise) continued on in NPS.<br><br>
                    I also joined coaching for JEE during this time in addition to school.<br><br>
                    It was fun.
